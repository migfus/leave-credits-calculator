Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 3, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use the Leave Credits Balance Calculator (the "Application").

1. No Data Collection
   The Application is designed to function entirely offline. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information, usage data, or device identifiers. Any data you input into the calculator (such as leave dates or employee names) stays strictly on your local device and is never transmitted to any external servers.

2. Third-Party Services
   The Application does not use any third-party SDKs, analytics tools (like Firebase), or advertising networks (like AdMob). There are no hidden trackers within the code.

3. Open Source Transparency
   In the interest of transparency, the source code for this Application is publicly available for audit. You can verify our "no-collection" claim by reviewing the code at:

[Insert your GitHub/GitLab URL here]

4. Permissions
   The Application requires no special permissions (e.g., no access to camera, microphone, or contacts) to function.

5. Changes to This Policy
   If this policy is updated in the future, the "Last Updated" date at the top will be changed. However, since the app is offline by design, any change that would require data collection would be a significant version update.

6. Contact Us
